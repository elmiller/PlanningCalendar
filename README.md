Calendar Creator
=========

Python script to create a plain text, linear calendar for lesson planning.

## About

The idea for this script was born soon after my first child. After returning to work, I found myself trying to get my lesson planning done while holding my baby as he drifted off to sleep. I tried using a Google Calendar, but found the format too constraining to write out my ideas, so I started writing out my ideas in Evernote. I soon realized it would be helpful to have the dates listed out for me in advance, so I could plan ahead for the month.

Since I was working on my phone, I used [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) to write out this script. I was new to Python at the time, but was able to get this script working within a few nights.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line with `./calcreate.py`.

The script will ask for the month and year:  
`Enter month number: 9`  
`Enter year: 2013`

The script will then list the weekdays for the specified month in the following format:

Monday, September 02, 2013  
LA  
EH  

Tuesday, September 03, 2013  
LA  
EH  

Wednesday, September 04, 2013  
LA  
EH  

Thursday, September 05, 2013  
LA  
EH  

Friday, September 06, 2013  
LA  
EH
